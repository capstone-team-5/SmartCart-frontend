# $mrtCART Frontend

Welcome to the $mrtCART front end application! This front end is designed with one core mission: to cater to the needs of shoppers who are seeking an effortless way to compare prices. Our backend empowers users to make informed purchasing decisions by providing them with a seamless and convenient experience when it comes to comparing prices for their desired products.

## The Concept

At the heart of $mrtCART lies a simple yet powerful idea: making price comparison a breeze for shoppers. The main logic of the application revolves around a user-friendly process that begins with users selecting their desired location and entering their grocery list. Once the grocery list is entered, the magic of the $mrtCART backend comes into play.
