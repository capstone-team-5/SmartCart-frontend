        Mission Statement:
        <br />
        <br />
        Our mission is to empower individuals and families to save time and
        money on their grocery shopping. We address the common challenge faced
        by people seeking savings on grocery bills but lacking the time to
        compare prices across various supermarkets, including non-traditional
        stores like Indian, Russian, and Asian markets. Our application
        streamlines the shopping experience by allowing users to create a cart
        that calculates and compares total prices across multiple stores within
        their desired radius. Our app enables users to select grocery stores,
        compare total prices, and identifies the store offering the best overall
        value for their shopping needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, users can search for individual items like onions and
        easily find the most affordable option at a specific store. However,
        when users add multiple items to their cart, such as onions, potatoes,
        and tomatoes, our app reveals the store that offers the most
        cost-efficient combination.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our application caters to individuals seeking both time and cost
        efficiency. Users benefit from the convenience of obtaining the best
        prices for their entire shopping list in one place, ultimately saving
        them time and money.
        <br />
        <br />
        To develop our application further we will utilize resources such as
        geolocation, various APIs, and potentially web scraping to gather
        real-time price data directly from store websites.
